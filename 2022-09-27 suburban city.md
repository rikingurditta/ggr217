>
> \- Robert Fishman in *Bourgeois Utopias*

## Suburban space

5 components of sprawl:

1. Subdivision
2. The mall and the strip mall
3. The office park
4. "Civil" space
5. Roads

### Isolation

- "community" has lost meaning when there is no communal aspect of living
- people are isolated when they live in a suburb, enter their car through their garage, drive alone through highway to get to city, park their care in a parking garage, go up to their office - can travel from home to office without ever coming face to face with another person
