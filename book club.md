## Big takeaways

### My ideas

- fatalities are a big product of policy
  - USA's fatalities have been increasing while Canada's and most of Europe's have been decreasing
    - why decreasing in Canada? don't we have similar policy? (and resulting cultural norms, e.g. most popular vehicle is huge pickup truck)
  - 

### Tom's ideas

- tom's big takeaway: disproportionate fatalities in minorities
  - lack of infrastructure
  - turning blind eyes
- lack of infrastructure
  - e.g. lack of streetlights
- crossings
  - made for average speed
  - most american cities have essential services across a huge boulevard

# Book club 2 (2022-10-19)

- chapter 3 about historical and current shift of blame from drivers to pedestrians
- easy to consume news media uncritically
  - absorb subtle assigning of blame from way media discusses it
- case study about Raquel Nelson was infuriating
  - chapter 4 discusses how jaywalking is nebulous and not policed fairly, reasonably, or precisely
- car culture a result of hardcore lobbying from car and related industries, not an organic culture shift
  - was a lot of pushback to it which was eventually quashed ... because it lost
- "counterfactuals" are used to shift blame
  - these arguments may have no legal basis
  - usually unreasonable
  - removes context of incident
- laws and lawmakers place equal responsibility of road safety on drivers and pedestrians
- police harass anyone with pretense of pedestrian safety
  - lot of police violence justified using pedestrian violations
  - policing not done precisely
- policing completely ineffectual way of improving public safety
