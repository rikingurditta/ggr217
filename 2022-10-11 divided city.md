# The Divided City

## Redlining

### Racial wealth gap

- white families have much more property
- latinos and african americans have much less debt
- white families have a higher net worth
- latinos are least likely to receive an inheritance
- white people inherit much more money

### Origins of redlining

- in response to great depression, Roosevelt created Home Owners Loan Corporation and Federal Housing Authority
  - "it was national policy to protect home ownership" - Jackson 1980
- appraisals: appraiser goes to neighbourhood, decides the level of risk when lending to someone in this neighbourhood
  - based on racial criteria
  - practice of appraisals was not new, but standardization, institutionalization, simplification turned it into a huge systematic problem
- standardization of loan process made it easier (for elligible people) to buy homes, accelerating suburbanization and also decay of inner city neighbourhoods by stripping middle class
