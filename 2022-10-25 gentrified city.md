# The Gentrified City

## The rise of real estate capital

- home ownership at a 50 year record low but real estate market moving fast

### Samuel Stein's Contradictions

- land is an asset but also required for shelter
- the rhetoric and reality are mismatched similarly

### Industrial vs rentier capital

- industrialists owen and manage industry
  - "make stuff"
  - creates new wealth
  - profits through surplus value, reinvests into production
  - rely on state to create new workers
- rentiers live on income from property or securities
  - makes money by owning and renting things
  - rely on state to protect property
  - exhausts profit
- both want infrastructure, welfare functions, police to protect investment, minimal taxes
- industrial capital and real estate capital have some interests at odds
  - industrial capital doesn't want environmental regulation, real estate supports it
  - industry wants affordable housing to support workers, real estate wants maximal rent
  - industry wants cheap land to use for production, real estate capital wants increasing land value
  - industry sees land as deplorable, real estate sees land as investible
- capital flight - industry leaves, real estate has an opportunity to buy low/invest/sell high

### Real estate state

- "government aligned with the needs and demands of this specific strain of capital"
- planners need to create property value
  - public improvements become private investment opportunities

## Gentrification

### Four theories of gentrification

1. Social ecology
   - gentrification is a natural process that mimics biological processes
   - Stupid ass theory
   - "these are not just insubstantial - not supported by data - but they are insidious"
2. Political economy
   - gentrification occurs as the result of capital seeking 
3. Cultural theories
   - 
4. neo-classical
   - result of rational decisions by everyone

### Blaming artists

- artists are workers - cannot blame them for displacing workers, since they are not inherently another class
- 

### The role of the state
