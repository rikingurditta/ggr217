[yet] it will not be found stated in large type in text books on land use. It has generated much less debate than the otehr organizing principles of the contemporary American city..."

- Good homes rooted workers to one place, limiting their tendency to move around to follow better jobs
  - also gave them a sense of contentedness that distracted from discontent with their work
  - also propped up real estate industry
- emerging lifestyle of men taking care of production and women taking care of consumption

> "Thus the private suburban house was the stage set for the effective sexual division of labor. It was the commodity par excellence, a spur for male paid labor and a container for female unpaid labor. It made gender appear a more important self-definition than class, and consumption more involving than production."
