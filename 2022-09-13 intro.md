### Urbanism

- Refers to "ways of life" and interaction with others that are specific to cities
- Urban life is influenced by identities and differences, e.g. gender, race, sexuality, age, class, disability
- Helps focus on urban places as *fundamentally peopled* - how they live, how chnages are negotiated, how relationships are managed

> is just one sort of landscape"
